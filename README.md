# Javascript: Introduction to jQuery

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

* Substitute jQuery methods for vanilla JS DOM manipulation methods
* Reference jQuery documentation when learning a new technique

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repo.
1. Change into the project directory.
1. Follow your instructor's instructions.

## Exercise

The code provided in this repo is a simple list-keeping app. We worked through this code yesterday, reading and annotating to get a better idea of how the app worked.

You may either follow along as I refactor this code to use jQuery, or you may focus on taking notes. The app will be available in its jQuery implementation on another branch.
