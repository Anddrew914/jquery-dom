# Javascript: Introduction to jQuery

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

* Substitute jQuery methods for vanilla JS DOM manipulation methods
* Reference jQuery documentation when learning a new technique

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repo.
1. Change into the project directory.
1. Follow your instructor's instructions.

## Exercise

The code provided in this repo is a simple list-keeping app. We worked through this code yesterday, reading and annotating to get a better idea of how the app worked.

You may either follow along as I refactor this code to use jQuery, or you may focus on taking notes. The app will be available in its jQuery implementation on another branch.

Our general approach will be:

1. `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. `grunt browserify` to put all of our JS in one file (this will be important later).
1. Change our application code to use jQuery. When we don't know how to do something, we'll first Google for a hint and the check the jQuery documentation.
1. `grunt browserify` and refresh the page each time we want see our changes.
1. Commit our changes when we've finished.
